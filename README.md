This is a personal website I created as a tribute to Khalil Fong 
— not for any commercial or real-life purpose, but simply as a way 
to remember and celebrate a truly wonderful and kind soul.

The website features:
- An About section introducing Khalil
- His Discography
- A curated Photo Wall
- A Video Gallery

At the end of the site, you'll find a quote from Khalil that serves as a personal wish to everyone who visits:

「祝你在未来的日子里，继续怀抱梦想，持续努力，成长进化， 在人生的每个阶段充分发挥自己的潜能。」
「May we continue to dream, strive, evolve, and fully realize our potential at every stage of life.」

🛠️ Project Notes

This is the first website I've ever built, made entirely for personal learning and expression. 
It's far from perfect and has much room for improvement, 
but it marks an important milestone in my journey as a developer.

I drew immense inspiration from the FU MUSIC Official Website, which influenced both the design and the vibe of this project. I also learned a lot about animations and effects from talented creators on CodePen, all of whom are credited in my notes.

🤍 Final Thoughts

This project represents both my admiration for Khalil Fong and my first step into web development. 
Thank you for visiting — I hope you find a little inspiration here, just as I did while building it.
